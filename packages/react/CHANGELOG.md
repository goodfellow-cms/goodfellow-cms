### Minor Changes

- caa6d55: Calendars: collections get a "Date and time, for events" field (`event`), with all-day events, end times and repeats (daily, weekly on chosen days, monthly on a date or a weekday of the month, yearly, every so often, until a date, with dates to skip), in the site's new time zone setting. A collection whose settings name its event field (`calendar`) is a calendar: builds write it as `/calendars/<id>.ics` for visitors to subscribe to, and each event as its own file. The new Calendar block shows events coming up, or a month at a time with a page for each month, from a collection, another calendar's `.ics` address (read when the site is built) or both, with "Add to calendar" and "Subscribe" links; Add to calendar does the same on an event's page. Collection list and Entry field show events' next times. New collections can start as Events. `sitePages()` lists the pages builds write, month pages included, and `goodfellow-next finish` writes calendar files into Next.js exports. Repeats are expanded, and calendar files read and written, with [ical.js](https://github.com/kewisch/ical.js).
- 4b44513: Site settings can open links to other sites in a new tab ("Open links to other sites in a new tab" under General), for menus, buttons, rich text and Markdown. Links in rich text now open in the same tab otherwise: Puck opened every one in a new tab, marked `nofollow`, including links to the site's own pages.
- a210b23: Showing collections. Collection list gets a heading with a link beside it, filters by a choice or tags field, Z to A and any-field ordering, later pages (`/news/page/2`) and a page for each choice of a field (`/news/topics/music`). The new Collection loop block repeats blocks designed in the editor once for each item, with its values in placeholders such as `{title}`. Collections get a Tags field type (`tags`), for any number of a list's choices. Blocks can add pages to the page they're on with `withPages()` from `@goodfellow-cms/core`, which the Calendar block's month pages now use: `sitePages()` takes the site's blocks, and `Page.view` and `useSite().view` replace `Page.month` and `useSite().month`. `repeatsForEntries()` from `@goodfellow-cms/react` makes a block repeat its blocks for each item.
- 8f9eff2: A Video block: a video from the media library (MP4 or WebM, with a picture before it plays and WebVTT captions), YouTube (from its ID or any of its addresses, in the privacy-enhanced player), Vimeo (with do not track), or another site's player (from its embed address or code, sandboxed, and only from another secure site). It needs no JavaScript on the page. `youtubeVideo()`, `vimeoVideo()`, `embedPlayerUrl()` and the player addresses' helpers are in `@goodfellow-cms/core`. Media fields can hold videos (`mediaField(label, "video")`), whose chooser offers only videos, and WebVTT files can be uploaded.

### Patch Changes

- c97095c: The Form and Contact details blocks' notes in the editor link to Site Settings, scrolled to Forms or Contact details (`useSite().adminLink()`, which the editor supplies). The Form block also says when Web3Forms' free plan won't send visitors to a thank-you page on another site. "Get an access key from Web3Forms" opens Web3Forms' sign-up form, and the admin panel's menu says "Header & Footer" and "Site Settings".
- 699e0dd: Goodfellow's repository moved to the `goodfellow-cms` organization on GitHub. Package READMEs and repository links, and the admin panel's link to release notes, now point to https://github.com/goodfellow-cms/goodfellow-cms and the documentation at https://goodfellow-cms.github.io/goodfellow-cms/.
  
  The starters' READMEs link to the documentation instead of sections of Goodfellow's README, which is now shorter.
- a5fe669: Next.js sites send visitors much less JavaScript: the starter's pages load 186 kB (gzipped) instead of 513 kB. `@goodfellow-cms/react` is now built one file per module, so Client Components that import `SiteLink`, `SiteImage` or `useSite` from it, such as the Search block's box and the image carousel, no longer bring Puck and the page renderer with them.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- fd6f851: Blocks from block registries. The admin panel has a **Blocks** screen that adds blocks built with shadcn/ui to the editor, and removes them, with no developer: adding one publishes its code into the site's `blocks/installed/` and the shadcn components it uses into `components/ui/`, in one commit, and the editor offers it once the site has been rebuilt. Removing a block is refused while content uses it, and keeps files someone has changed.
  
  `@goodfellow-cms/registry` is Goodfellow's registry, with nine blocks: Hero, Cards, Call to action, Testimonials, Notice, Pricing table, FAQ, Tabs and Image carousel. Its README documents the format for registries of blocks built with other libraries, which a site offers once its config lists them in `registries`.
  
  `create-goodfellow` starts new sites with the recommended blocks, or with `--blocks built-in` the built-in blocks only. `@goodfellow-cms/core` plans installs and removals (`planInstall()`, `planRemove()`), and its stores and the GitLab backend read and write the folders installed blocks use. `goodfellow dev` and `next dev` serve the site's copy of the registry, and `goodfellow` resolves `@/` imports from the site's root, as shadcn code expects. `@goodfellow-cms/react`'s theme adds the colors shadcn components use, such as `card` and `destructive`.
- 5492e22: Collections and templates. A collection, such as videos or events, lives in `content/collections/<name>/`: a `_collection.json` with its fields, an address pattern such as `/videos/{slug}` and a Puck template, plus one file per item. `goodfellow build` and `goodfellow dev` give every item a page from its collection's template, where `{field}` placeholders and the new template-only Entry field block show the item's values. The new Collection list block shows a collection's items on any page, as a list or cards, newest first, upcoming only, and so on. The admin panel has a Collections screen for creating collections, editing their fields and page design, and adding, editing, renaming and deleting items. `@goodfellow-cms/core` adds `allPages()`, `findEntry()` and the collection schemas; `@goodfellow-cms/react` adds a `template` Puck config, `templateOnly()` and `applyEntry()`.
- 2af75b7: Site settings has a Code tab for code from services such as Google Analytics: "In the page head" (script, style, link, meta, base and noscript tags, read with `parseHeadCode()`) and "At the end of the page" (any HTML), saved as `content/code/head.html` and `content/code/body.html`. `goodfellow build` and Next.js add it to every page with `HeadCode` and `BodyCode`; it never runs in the admin panel.
- ce5faee: A Custom HTML block in Goodfellow's block registry (not recommended, under "Advanced"), for HTML written by hand. `sanitizeHtml()` makes it safe by default; used exactly as written, it runs on the site but only in a sandboxed frame in the editor.
- 405de70: Client Components in blocks (`"use client"`) now run in the browser on sites built with `goodfellow build` and served by `goodfellow dev`, not only with Next.js. Each one a block uses becomes an island: its HTML is in the page as before, and the page loads React and that component's code to bring it to life, with `useSite()`, `useId()` and content passed as `children` working as they do in Next.js. Pages without Client Components still load no JavaScript. Client Components in packages of blocks are found too.
  
  `goodfellow build` now always bundles for production, so the admin panel no longer ships React's development build. `@goodfellow-cms/core` is published one file per module, so browser bundles that only need a helper such as `withBase()` leave out the content schemas.
- ece9ba5: The media library. A new **Media** screen uploads, replaces and deletes images and files in `public/media/`, saying where a file is used before deleting it. Image fields in blocks, page settings, collection items and site settings get a **Choose image** button that picks from the library or uploads a new file. Large photos are shrunk, JPEGs lose hidden details such as location, SVGs lose scripts, and only file types that can't run code are accepted. Previews show new uploads straight away, and add the site's base path to media addresses. `FileChange` can now carry `bytes`, and every store implements `readBytes()`, with both backends, their fakes and the development server supporting uploads. `@goodfellow-cms/react` adds `mediaField()`, used by the Image and Section blocks, and the AI assistant is told which images the site has.
- 04fc203: The Next.js starter shows the header and footer in a layout (`app/(site)/layout.tsx`, from `goodfellowPages().Layout`), so they stay as they are when moving between pages, and pages only send their own content. `@goodfellow-cms/react` exports `PageHeader`, `PageContent`, `PageFooter` and `prepareLayout()`. Menu marks current links with `data-current` and `aria-current`, which Next.js's layout sets in the browser, since it doesn't know the current page. In `next dev`, `withGoodfellow()` turns off React's debug channel, which made the browser's memory grow to gigabytes with the header and footer in a layout.
- de03c18: Add `@goodfellow-cms/next`, which puts a Goodfellow site in a Next.js app, exported as static files. Pages render as Server Components; blocks' links to the site's pages use `next/link` and images `next/image`, sites can be served from a subfolder (`basePath` or `GOODFELLOW_BASE`), and blocks can render Client Components with any hooks. In `next dev` the admin panel saves to the files on disk. `create-goodfellow` can start from a Next.js version of the starter (`--template next`).
  
  `@goodfellow-cms/react` gains a Server Components version (picked through the `react-server` condition), `preparePage()`, and `SiteLink` and `SiteImage`, which blocks use for links and images so they follow the site's base path and the renderer's components. The built-in blocks use them. `@goodfellow-cms/core` gains `withBase()`, `applyBasePath()` and `imageSize()`, and `@goodfellow-cms/core/node` reading sites from disk, image sizes, the local file store and the development API.
- cff2c58: Static rendering. `goodfellow build` turns a site's `content/` folder into static HTML, with Tailwind CSS built from the class names used in content, a sitemap, and support for serving from a subfolder. `goodfellow dev` re-renders pages as content changes, and `goodfellow preview` serves the built site. Includes the content file format (with versioning and migrations), the page renderer, and ten built-in blocks.

### Patch Changes

- 652b180: Markdown collections, code highlighting, search and blocks for documentation sites.
  
  - **Markdown collections:** a collection can store its items as Markdown files (`markdown: { body }` in its settings), with the other fields as YAML front matter. The admin panel's collection settings turn it on and convert every item; the body is edited in the formatted editor or a Markdown tab, and Markdown the formatted editor can't show, such as a table, is edited as Markdown only. `@goodfellow-cms/core` adds `parseMarkdownEntry()`, `serializeMarkdownEntry()`, `markdownToHtml()`, `markdownParts()`, `markdownHeadings()` and `canFormatMarkdown()`; HTML in Markdown is shown as text, and only safe addresses are kept.
  - **Code block:** code highlighted with Shiki when the site is built, with a title and a copy button. Code in Markdown text is highlighted too.
  - **Search block:** searches the site in the visitor's browser with Pagefind. Builds index a site only when a page has a search block (`data-goodfellow-search`); `goodfellow build` does it, `goodfellow index` indexes any built site, and Next.js sites run `goodfellow-next index out` after `next build`. Pages mark their main content for indexing.
  - **Collection navigation**, **Previous and next** and **On this page** blocks, for documentation and other sites with ordered collections.
  - Formatted text styles tables, images and code.
- 536f2a8: License under MIT.
- 4ca2dc1: Every package has a README, keywords and links to its documentation, repository and issues, for its page on npm. All the packages are released together with the same version.
- d91eea1: The packages are published under the `@goodfellow-cms` scope on npm, such as `@goodfellow-cms/core` and `@goodfellow-cms/react`, since `@goodfellow` was taken. `goodfellow` and `create-goodfellow` keep their names, and the block registry's name in `components.json` and refs such as `@goodfellow/shadcn-faq` stays `@goodfellow`.
- 3a4c60d: `cx()` now resolves conflicting Tailwind classes with tailwind-merge, so CSS classes added to a block in the editor override the block's own styles.
