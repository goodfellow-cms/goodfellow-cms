# @goodfellow-cms/github

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- f591bc0: Plugins can keep a site's media in a storage service in place of `public/media/`, as S3 storage (`goodfellow-plugin-s3`, in a repository of its own) does. A plugin with `mediaStorage` takes the Media screen's uploads, larger ones too, and `content/media-storage.json` lists the files it keeps by their `/media/` addresses, which builds, `goodfellow dev` and Next.js show from the storage's public address, so pages don't change. The Media screen moves the site's own files there and back.
  
  Plugins can also run tasks in the site's CI, with secrets the admin panel never holds: an admin module calls `api.task(id, input)`, and the starters' new `.github/workflows/plugin-task.yml`, or the `plugin-task` job in `.gitlab-ci.yml`, runs `goodfellow task` (`goodfellow-next task`) with only the secrets the plugin declared, sealing the answer to a key only that admin panel holds. It takes about a minute. `goodfellow dev` and `next dev` run tasks on the computer, and full-stack sites pass them through their server. Sites made earlier copy the starter's `plugin-task.yml`, or the `plugin-task` job and the `pages` job's new rule, to run tasks.
  
  Plugins' screens fill the screen as the admin panel's own do, drawing their own heading in a frame as tall as what they draw. `api.secretsHelp()` tells a plugin how the site's owner adds its secrets for this site, in steps for GitHub, GitLab, the development servers' `.env.local` or a full-stack site's server, and a site's config can give a plugin `options`.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 043358b: Add a token broker from the admin panel: Site Settings' Security tab makes the broker's repository from Goodfellow's released page, with a token that can create repositories, and puts it online with GitHub Pages (at a domain of its own) or GitLab Pages (at the project's unique domain), or leaves it ready for Cloudflare Pages or Vercel. `goodfellow broker add`, `use` and `remove` do the same from a computer. `create-goodfellow` (`--admin`, `--broker`, `--broker-domain`) and the setup page offer an admin address or a sign-in page of its own for new sites. The docs have a new Security page.
- 938e468: An address of its own for the admin panel, such as `admin.example.org`, so the site's pages can't reach what it keeps. Site Settings' Domain screen sets it on GitLab Pages, Cloudflare Pages and Vercel, writing the config's new `admin` line: `goodfellow build` and `goodfellow-next finish` then start every page with a script that sends it to the Site address when it's opened at the admin address, fail if a page can't start with it, and write Cloudflare Pages' header rules, while the starters' `vercel.ts` and `withGoodfellow()` give Vercel's. Once the admin panel has checked the address from there, it opens only there and refuses to be shown in a frame. The sign-in worker gives tokens to the admin address too. The Blocks screen offers blocks from the config's `registries`, and shadcn/ui's own, only at a checked admin address and in `goodfellow dev` and `next dev`. GitLab's backend can publish files outside the editable folders, such as the config.
- e819602: Cloudflare Pages as a host. `create-goodfellow --host cloudflare-pages` and the setup page give a site a nightly update and rebuild, and the checks for scheduled changes, on GitHub Actions or GitLab CI, which ask Cloudflare to rebuild through the project's deploy hook (`CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOY_HOOK`). The admin panel shows when Cloudflare has built the site, from its check runs and commit statuses, and GitHub token links ask for Commit statuses. `goodfellow build` and `goodfellow-next finish` write `_redirects`, so Cloudflare sends the site's redirects itself. The Domain screen explains connecting a domain in Cloudflare, and the media library notes Cloudflare's terms for videos.
- e62801d: Drafts in the admin panel. The editors' **Add to draft**, beside **Publish**, keeps a change on a draft branch instead of publishing it, and while a draft is open every Publish adds to it. A bar on every screen shows the draft, with **Publish all**, which runs the site checks over everything in it and publishes it in one change with one rebuild, **Submit for review**, **Throw away** and **Back to the live site**. Drafts stay when the tab closes, other editors see them, and ones started from Claude can be finished there. Full-stack sites, demos and the development servers keep the draft in the browser instead (`keptDrafts()`). Drafts can be listed (`SiteDrafts.list()`), list the files they changed (`Draft.paths()`), and start at a given revision (`create(name, { from })`). The starters' `vercel.ts` turns off Vercel's previews of draft branches; existing sites on Vercel can add its `git: { deploymentEnabled: { "goodfellow-draft-*": false } }` line, and sites on Cloudflare Pages can set preview branches to None.
- 9b96dd3: The editor's sandbox. The admin panel's page, which signs in and publishes, no longer loads the site's config or any block's code: Puck, the config and every block run in frames sandboxed without `allow-same-origin`, which talk to the page through one message port, so blocks can't reach editors' tokens or AI keys. The page draws the editor's header, Undo and Redo, preview widths, Publish and the AI panel outside the frame; the Settings, Version history and Site history previews, the pages rendered to check a publish and the preview page for screenshots are frames too. The site's CSS is kept to the editor's canvas, with its width media queries as container queries, so the phone and tablet buttons show the site at those widths. The frames' Content Security Policy lets them fetch nothing and run only the site's own scripts, which first remove WebRTC.
  
  `Admin` takes `site` (`adminSite()` from `@goodfellow-cms/react`) and `frames` in place of `config`; `GitHost.source` lets the admin panel make the site's git host again. `goodfellow build` writes the frames' page at `admin/editor/`. Next.js sites get `app/admin/editor/page.tsx` (`GoodfellowEditor` from `@goodfellow-cms/next/editor`), their `app/admin/page.tsx` becomes a server component passing `site.admin()` to `GoodfellowAdmin`, and `goodfellow-next finish` writes the editor page's policy. An `app/admin/page.tsx` that still passes `config` loads every block's code itself, so the admin panel only says how to update it there and never signs in; `goodfellow-next update` replaces it with the starter's, and adds the editor page, wherever nobody has changed it, on its first run after this release. Every frame is sandboxed with `allow-scripts` alone, in `goodfellow dev` and `next dev` too: they bundle the frames as builds do, rebuild them as the site's code changes and reload the frames, leaving the admin panel's page as it is. `@goodfellow-cms/next` depends on Rolldown for that, loaded only in `next dev`.
- 564d1dc: Sites rebuild overnight only when visitors would see something new. Every build writes `goodfellow-build.json` with what it was built from and when what it shows by today's date next changes, and the starters' setups run `goodfellow nightly` (or `goodfellow-next nightly`) first each night, building only when there are fixes to install, something dated has changed, or the live site isn't the newest build. On GitLab Pages, a night with nothing new publishes the live site's files again. The Updates screen lets owners choose to rebuild overnight only when something changed, every night or never, and has Rebuild now. On GitHub the choice is the `GOODFELLOW_NIGHTLY` repository variable, which the sign-in service's owners' app now asks for the Variables permission to set.
- 8ac5d0e: Restore the whole site as it was at an earlier publish, from Site Settings → Site history: every publish that changed the site's pages, items, settings or media, how the site looked after each, with its pictures, what has changed since, and restoring everything in `content/` and `public/media/` in one publish. Backends gain `filesAt(revision)`, which reads the site's files as they were, and `history()` lists a folder's publishes as well as a file's.
- 200f868: Safer builds on GitHub: every job in the starters' workflows, and in the ones new sites get, has only the permissions it needs. The jobs that run the site's code can only read the repository and keep no credentials in it, and the nightly update builds the site before a separate job, which runs none of its code, publishes it (`goodfellow update --commit`). Sites' `.npmrc` turns off packages' install scripts. The admin panel's page has a Content Security Policy that keeps its frames on the editor's pages. Existing sites can copy the starter's `.github/workflows/` and `.npmrc` to get the same.
- 74bb2ad: Scheduled publishing: pages and collection items can be shown from a time and hidden after one (`showFrom` and `hideAfter` in their files, in the site's time zone), which builds, `goodfellow dev` and Next.js apply, leaving menus' links to them out until they're shown. The admin panel schedules pages from the Pages screen and items in their editor, lists what's coming up, and warns that scheduled content can be read early on a public repository. On GitLab it adds a pipeline schedule at each time, so changes go live then; the starters' new `.github/workflows/scheduled.yml` checks each hour with the new `goodfellow due` command and builds the site only when something has come due. Letting editors publish on GitLab now lets Developers merge too, which adding those schedules needs.

### Patch Changes

- 93c5b2c: Goodfellow needs Node.js 22.23.4, 24.22.1 or 26.12.1 or later. Earlier versions decompress Brotli unsafely (CVE-2026-111497, "Node2Shell"). Builds read other sites, such as Calendar blocks' feeds, so a feed's server could run code on the computer building the site. New sites' GitHub workflows (`deploy.yml`, `scheduled.yml`) set up Node with `check-latest: true`, so they always get the newest Node 22 instead of an older copy on GitHub's runner. To do the same on an existing site, add `check-latest: true` under `node-version: 22` in each `actions/setup-node` step of its `.github/workflows/` files. GitLab's `node:22` image already has the fix. On Cloudflare Pages and Vercel, check the Node.js version in the project's build settings.
- 2901de0: A publish made while a GitLab Pages site is still building now cancels that build and builds both, so publishing several pages one after another mostly costs one build: the starters' and the content repository's GitLab Pages jobs are `interruptible`. The admin panel no longer reports a build that a newer publish cancelled or replaced as failed, on GitLab or GitHub: it follows the newer build instead.
  
  Existing sites on GitLab Pages can add `interruptible: true` to the `pages` job in their `.gitlab-ci.yml` to get the same.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 6328aff: Finishing content in a repository of its own (roadmap step 25).
  
  - The setup page offers it under "Where to keep the content". It creates the code's repository and the content's, and connects them: on GitHub, private repositories get read-only deploy keys, with their private halves as Actions secrets of the repository that reads them; on GitLab, each project joins the other's job token allowlist, and the code project's job token may publish updates, with a nightly pipeline schedule. `SetupAccount.createSite()` takes `more` and `link` for this, and `separateSetupLinks()` says what connects a site's repositories.
  - `github({ repo, contentOnly: true, code })` and `gitlab({ project, contentOnly: true, code })` name the code repository, which new sites' configs now do, and the Updates screen follows its update job: the site's release, running updates and the last run, for people who can see it (`SiteUpdates.code`, and `no-access` where they can't). Going back to an older release from the Updates screen also skips the release it left. On GitHub, the sign-in service gives a second token for the code repository, which can only read it and its workflow runs, or for owners, run them.
  - The GitHub setup page's token links ask for Secrets as well, for the deploy keys.
- 72607c8: A site's content can be kept in a repository of its own (roadmap step 25), so editors' sign-in, publishing and a full-stack site's server can change the content but never the code.
  
  - `github({ repo, contentOnly: true })` and `gitlab({ project, contentOnly: true })` point the admin panel at a repository that holds only `content/` and `public/media/`. Backends refuse to write anything else (`CodeChangeError`), and so does a full-stack site's API. The admin panel has no Blocks screen there, since adding a block changes the code, and its Updates screen says updates run where the code is.
  - `goodfellow content link` and `goodfellow-next content link` link `content/` and `public/media/` to the content repository in `content-repository/`, so `goodfellow dev` and `next dev` read and save its files; `content copy` copies them instead, as builds do. The dev servers and builds say what to run when the content hasn't been put in place.
  - `npm create goodfellow` asks where the content should be kept, or takes `--content your-name/your-site-content` and, on Vercel, `--build content|code`. It makes both repositories, with setup files for each: GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages build the site from the content repository, which checks out the code, while the code's repository runs the nightly update and asks for a rebuild after each change to the code; Vercel builds from either.
  - The Next.js starter's GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages setups now build with `npm run build`, so they run `goodfellow-next finish out` too, which writes the search index, calendar files and redirect pages.
- 4caf245: Full-stack Next.js sites (roadmap step 24): a Next.js app with a server of its own can be a Goodfellow site whose editors sign in with the app's own sign-in, while its server reads and publishes through GitHub or GitLab with one token that never reaches a browser.
  
  - `goodfellowApi()` from `@goodfellow-cms/next/server` is the admin panel's API, as a catch-all route. The app's `authorize(request)` says who's signed in and whether they're an `editor` or an `owner`; only owners change Site Settings, blocks, and collections' settings and templates, which the server checks on every write. Commits name the editor as their author.
  - `<GoodfellowAdmin server="/api/goodfellow" />` signs in through the app, and `withGoodfellow(config, { server: true })` builds for a server instead of static files.
  - `ai: { anthropic: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }` sends the AI assistant's requests through the server with the site's key (`aiServer()` in `@goodfellow-cms/ai`), so editors don't need keys of their own.
  - `github()` and `gitlab()` have `server({ token })`, and core's `appApi()` (in `@goodfellow-cms/core/node`) is the API for other frameworks.
  - Calendar files and search are static on full-stack sites too: `goodfellow-next finish --server`, after `next build`, writes the calendar files into `public/calendars/` and indexes the pages Next.js rendered into `public/pagefind/`.
- e8cd390: Goodfellow doesn't run a hosted sign-in service yet, so `github()` and `githubSetup()` no longer default to one: without `signIn`, editors sign in with a token, as they always could. Sites that run their own sign-in service name its address in `github({ signIn })`, as before. `GOODFELLOW_SIGN_IN` is removed.

  - @goodfellow-cms/core@0.4.0

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 6532990: Work on your site from Claude. Add Goodfellow's connector to Claude, sign in with GitHub or GitLab and choose your sites; Claude can then read and change pages, items, the header and footer, menus and settings in a draft, show you screenshots of them, and publish the draft or submit it for review, as a pull request or merge request. The new `@goodfellow-cms/mcp` package runs the same tools on your own computer, for Claude Code (`npx @goodfellow-cms/mcp`) and as a Claude Desktop extension, signed in with a token. A site's config can stop Claude publishing with `claude: { publish: false }`, so it only submits its changes for review. Claude sees the media library's sizes and credits, and can look at its images in screenshots. The GitHub and GitLab backends say how large files are without reading them (`fileSizes()`).
  
  For this, every build publishes `goodfellow-site.json`, describing the site's blocks and the content formats it reads, and the admin panel has a preview page (`#/preview`) that shows unpublished content for screenshots. The GitHub and GitLab backends can keep changes in drafts (`drafts`) and read many files at once (`readFiles()`), and the admin panel's change helpers are in `@goodfellow-cms/core`.
- 2264969: Sign in with GitHub, through Goodfellow's sign-in service. Editors get a token for the site's repository only, lasting an hour and renewed while they're signed in, and what they publish names them as its author. The service stores nothing about anyone's sign-in: editors' own GitHub tokens are revoked as soon as they've signed in. The first time someone signs in, the sign-in screen offers to install Goodfellow on the site, and GitHub's install page signs them in too. It works at the address in the site's settings, never on this computer; elsewhere, and when the service's daily limit is reached, editors sign in with a token as before. Owners sign in with a second app, for one tab, on the Editors, Domain and Updates screens, and the setup page signs in, and installs Goodfellow where it creates sites, through the service too. `github({ signIn })` names your own copy of the service, or `false` turns it off.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f776202: Plain-language explanations of failed rebuilds: the top bar's **What went wrong?** says whether the host didn't start the build, packages couldn't be installed, Pages isn't set up, a content file has a problem (linking to its version history), or the site's code couldn't be built, with the host's details behind a toggle. `goodfellow build` prints what went wrong for the admin panel, and an annotation on GitHub Actions. The GitHub backend now reads the deploy workflow's run, so a build that fails before deploying is reported as failed rather than building; the sign-in token link asks for Actions: read. The owner token now lasts a day, the shortest GitHub allows, instead of a week.
- c8a935e: Custom domains: **Site settings → Domain** connects a domain to a site on GitHub Pages or GitLab Pages, lists the records to add at the registrar, and checks until it works (the records, the host's HTTPS certificate, and the site at its new address), then sends everyone to the secure address. Backends' new optional `pages` capability does the host's part; `checkRecords()` and `domainZone()` in core check DNS. GitHub tokens need the Pages permission to connect a domain, and the screen links to one that has it. Where editors sign in by being sent to the host and back, the screen reminds owners to allow the admin panel's new address.
- 03dc28f: Editors: **Site settings → Editors** lists who edits the site, and lets owners invite people (by username, or on GitLab by email), make them editors or owners, and remove them. Backends gain an optional `editors` capability. On GitHub, changing editors and GitHub Pages settings needs an owner token, which the new `ownerAccess` keeps in memory for the tab only; it replaces the Pages token link (`PagesDomains.tokenLink` is removed). On GitLab, owners can let editors publish to the main branch.
- 8176568: `githubSetup()` and `gitlabSetup()` create a site's repository from the browser, for the documentation site's setup page: they list the accounts and groups the person can create it in, create it on the branch `main` with every file in one first commit, and turn on GitHub Pages (or make a private project's GitLab Pages public). On GitHub they also add a rule that stops the main branch's history being rewritten or deleted, where the plan allows it. GitLab sign-in can be by redirect, with PKCE. The fakes in `@goodfellow-cms/github/testing` and `@goodfellow-cms/gitlab/testing` can create repositories too.
- d09a681: Automatic updates: `goodfellow update` (and `goodfellow-next update`) updates a site to Goodfellow's newest fixes, or a release it's given, with the Puck version that release uses, and updates blocks from Goodfellow's registry, replacing only files nobody changed (`planUpdate()`). It publishes the update only once the site installs and builds with it, and otherwise puts everything back. The starters' GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages setups run it each night. **Site settings → Updates** shows the site's release, fixes and newer releases, and the last update, installs fixes now, lets owners install a newer release, and on GitLab turns on job token pushes and a nightly schedule. Owners can turn automatic fixes off and go back to the previous release, which updates then skip until it's allowed again; these settings live in a new content file, `content/updates.json`. Backends gain an optional `updates` capability; the GitHub owner token can now run workflows.
- 7785ef5: Version history: pages, the header and footer, and collections' items have a **Version history** screen in the admin panel, listing every published version with who published it and when, a preview of each, and **Restore this version**, which publishes it again. Backends gain `history()` and `readAt()`, implemented for GitHub and GitLab and their fakes.

### Patch Changes

- 699e0dd: Goodfellow's repository moved to the `goodfellow-cms` organization on GitHub. Package READMEs and repository links, and the admin panel's link to release notes, now point to https://github.com/goodfellow-cms/goodfellow-cms and the documentation at https://goodfellow-cms.github.io/goodfellow-cms/.
  
  The starters' READMEs link to the documentation instead of sections of Goodfellow's README, which is now shorter.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1bfecf7: Publishing to GitHub and GitLab. New `@goodfellow-cms/github` and `@goodfellow-cms/gitlab` backends edit a site's repository straight from the browser: GitHub with an access token from a prefilled link, GitLab with one-click OAuth (PKCE) or a token. Set `backend` in `goodfellow.config.tsx` and `goodfellow build` includes the admin panel at `/admin/`, with a sign-in screen, an account menu and a live-site status that follows the deploy after each publish. `@goodfellow-cms/core` adds the `GitHost` and `GitBackend` interfaces, `writeChanges()` (which saves over other people's changes to other files but never the same ones), and `@goodfellow-cms/core/testing` with an in-memory repository for fakes. `goodfellow dev` gives each site its own Vite cache and keeps watching content when folders are replaced.
- ece9ba5: The media library. A new **Media** screen uploads, replaces and deletes images and files in `public/media/`, saying where a file is used before deleting it. Image fields in blocks, page settings, collection items and site settings get a **Choose image** button that picks from the library or uploads a new file. Large photos are shrunk, JPEGs lose hidden details such as location, SVGs lose scripts, and only file types that can't run code are accepted. Previews show new uploads straight away, and add the site's base path to media addresses. `FileChange` can now carry `bytes`, and every store implements `readBytes()`, with both backends, their fakes and the development server supporting uploads. `@goodfellow-cms/react` adds `mediaField()`, used by the Image and Section blocks, and the AI assistant is told which images the site has.

### Patch Changes

- 4ca2dc1: Every package has a README, keywords and links to its documentation, repository and issues, for its page on npm. All the packages are released together with the same version.
- d91eea1: The packages are published under the `@goodfellow-cms` scope on npm, such as `@goodfellow-cms/core` and `@goodfellow-cms/react`, since `@goodfellow` was taken. `goodfellow` and `create-goodfellow` keep their names, and the block registry's name in `components.json` and refs such as `@goodfellow/shadcn-faq` stays `@goodfellow`.
