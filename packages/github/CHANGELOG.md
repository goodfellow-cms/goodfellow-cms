# @goodfellow-cms/github

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f776202: Plain-language explanations of failed rebuilds: the top bar's **What went wrong?** says whether the host didn't start the build, packages couldn't be installed, Pages isn't set up, a content file has a problem (linking to its version history), or the site's code couldn't be built, with the host's details behind a toggle. `goodfellow build` prints what went wrong for the admin panel, and an annotation on GitHub Actions. The GitHub backend now reads the deploy workflow's run, so a build that fails before deploying is reported as failed rather than building; the sign-in token link asks for Actions: read. The owner token now lasts a day, the shortest GitHub allows, instead of a week.
- c8a935e: Custom domains: **Site settings → Domain** connects a domain to a site on GitHub Pages or GitLab Pages, lists the records to add at the registrar, and checks until it works (the records, the host's HTTPS certificate, and the site at its new address), then sends everyone to the secure address. Backends' new optional `pages` capability does the host's part; `checkRecords()` and `domainZone()` in core check DNS. GitHub tokens need the Pages permission to connect a domain, and the screen links to one that has it. Where editors sign in by being sent to the host and back, the screen reminds owners to allow the admin panel's new address.
- 03dc28f: Editors: **Site settings → Editors** lists who edits the site, and lets owners invite people (by username, or on GitLab by email), make them editors or owners, and remove them. Backends gain an optional `editors` capability. On GitHub, changing editors and GitHub Pages settings needs an owner token, which the new `ownerAccess` keeps in memory for the tab only; it replaces the Pages token link (`PagesDomains.tokenLink` is removed). On GitLab, owners can let editors publish to the main branch.
- 8176568: `githubSetup()` and `gitlabSetup()` create a site's repository from the browser, for the documentation site's setup page: they list the accounts and groups the person can create it in, create it on the branch `main` with every file in one first commit, and turn on GitHub Pages (or make a private project's GitLab Pages public). On GitHub they also add a rule that stops the main branch's history being rewritten or deleted, where the plan allows it. GitLab sign-in can be by redirect, with PKCE. The fakes in `@goodfellow-cms/github/testing` and `@goodfellow-cms/gitlab/testing` can create repositories too.
- d09a681: Automatic updates: `goodfellow update` (and `goodfellow-next update`) updates a site to Goodfellow's newest fixes, or a release it's given, with the Puck version that release uses, and updates blocks from Goodfellow's registry, replacing only files nobody changed (`planUpdate()`). It publishes the update only once the site installs and builds with it, and otherwise puts everything back. The starters' GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages setups run it each night. **Site settings → Updates** shows the site's release, fixes and newer releases, and the last update, installs fixes now, lets owners install a newer release, and on GitLab turns on job token pushes and a nightly schedule. Owners can turn automatic fixes off and go back to the previous release, which updates then skip until it's allowed again; these settings live in a new content file, `content/updates.json`. Backends gain an optional `updates` capability; the GitHub owner token can now run workflows.
- 7785ef5: Version history: pages, the header and footer, and collections' items have a **Version history** screen in the admin panel, listing every published version with who published it and when, a preview of each, and **Restore this version**, which publishes it again. Backends gain `history()` and `readAt()`, implemented for GitHub and GitLab and their fakes.

### Patch Changes

- 699e0dd: Goodfellow's repository moved to the `goodfellow-cms` organization on GitHub. Package READMEs and repository links, and the admin panel's link to release notes, now point to https://github.com/goodfellow-cms/goodfellow-cms and the documentation at https://goodfellow-cms.github.io/goodfellow-cms/.
  
  The starters' READMEs link to the documentation instead of sections of Goodfellow's README, which is now shorter.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1bfecf7: Publishing to GitHub and GitLab. New `@goodfellow-cms/github` and `@goodfellow-cms/gitlab` backends edit a site's repository straight from the browser: GitHub with an access token from a prefilled link, GitLab with one-click OAuth (PKCE) or a token. Set `backend` in `goodfellow.config.tsx` and `goodfellow build` includes the admin panel at `/admin/`, with a sign-in screen, an account menu and a live-site status that follows the deploy after each publish. `@goodfellow-cms/core` adds the `GitHost` and `GitBackend` interfaces, `writeChanges()` (which saves over other people's changes to other files but never the same ones), and `@goodfellow-cms/core/testing` with an in-memory repository for fakes. `goodfellow dev` gives each site its own Vite cache and keeps watching content when folders are replaced.
- ece9ba5: The media library. A new **Media** screen uploads, replaces and deletes images and files in `public/media/`, saying where a file is used before deleting it. Image fields in blocks, page settings, collection items and site settings get a **Choose image** button that picks from the library or uploads a new file. Large photos are shrunk, JPEGs lose hidden details such as location, SVGs lose scripts, and only file types that can't run code are accepted. Previews show new uploads straight away, and add the site's base path to media addresses. `FileChange` can now carry `bytes`, and every store implements `readBytes()`, with both backends, their fakes and the development server supporting uploads. `@goodfellow-cms/react` adds `mediaField()`, used by the Image and Section blocks, and the AI assistant is told which images the site has.

### Patch Changes

- 4ca2dc1: Every package has a README, keywords and links to its documentation, repository and issues, for its page on npm. All the packages are released together with the same version.
- d91eea1: The packages are published under the `@goodfellow-cms` scope on npm, such as `@goodfellow-cms/core` and `@goodfellow-cms/react`, since `@goodfellow` was taken. `goodfellow` and `create-goodfellow` keep their names, and the block registry's name in `components.json` and refs such as `@goodfellow/shadcn-faq` stays `@goodfellow`.
