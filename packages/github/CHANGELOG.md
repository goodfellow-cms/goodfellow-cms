# @goodfellow-cms/github

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 6532990: Work on your site from Claude. Add Goodfellow's connector to Claude, sign in with GitHub or GitLab and choose your sites; Claude can then read and change pages, items, the header and footer, menus and settings in a draft, show you screenshots of them, and publish the draft or submit it for review, as a pull request or merge request. The new `@goodfellow-cms/mcp` package runs the same tools on your own computer, for Claude Code (`npx @goodfellow-cms/mcp`) and as a Claude Desktop extension, signed in with a token. A site's config can stop Claude publishing with `claude: { publish: false }`, so it only submits its changes for review. Claude sees the media library's sizes and credits, and can look at its images in screenshots. The GitHub and GitLab backends say how large files are without reading them (`fileSizes()`).
  
  For this, every build publishes `goodfellow-site.json`, describing the site's blocks and the content formats it reads, and the admin panel has a preview page (`#/preview`) that shows unpublished content for screenshots. The GitHub and GitLab backends can keep changes in drafts (`drafts`) and read many files at once (`readFiles()`), and the admin panel's change helpers are in `@goodfellow-cms/core`.
- 2264969: Sign in with GitHub, through Goodfellow's sign-in service. Editors get a token for the site's repository only, lasting an hour and renewed while they're signed in, and what they publish names them as its author. The service stores nothing about anyone's sign-in: editors' own GitHub tokens are revoked as soon as they've signed in. The first time someone signs in, the sign-in screen offers to install Goodfellow on the site, and GitHub's install page signs them in too. It works at the address in the site's settings, never on this computer; elsewhere, and when the service's daily limit is reached, editors sign in with a token as before. Owners sign in with a second app, for one tab, on the Editors, Domain and Updates screens, and the setup page signs in, and installs Goodfellow where it creates sites, through the service too. `github({ signIn })` names your own copy of the service, or `false` turns it off.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f776202: Plain-language explanations of failed rebuilds: the top bar's **What went wrong?** says whether the host didn't start the build, packages couldn't be installed, Pages isn't set up, a content file has a problem (linking to its version history), or the site's code couldn't be built, with the host's details behind a toggle. `goodfellow build` prints what went wrong for the admin panel, and an annotation on GitHub Actions. The GitHub backend now reads the deploy workflow's run, so a build that fails before deploying is reported as failed rather than building; the sign-in token link asks for Actions: read. The owner token now lasts a day, the shortest GitHub allows, instead of a week.
- c8a935e: Custom domains: **Site settings → Domain** connects a domain to a site on GitHub Pages or GitLab Pages, lists the records to add at the registrar, and checks until it works (the records, the host's HTTPS certificate, and the site at its new address), then sends everyone to the secure address. Backends' new optional `pages` capability does the host's part; `checkRecords()` and `domainZone()` in core check DNS. GitHub tokens need the Pages permission to connect a domain, and the screen links to one that has it. Where editors sign in by being sent to the host and back, the screen reminds owners to allow the admin panel's new address.
- 03dc28f: Editors: **Site settings → Editors** lists who edits the site, and lets owners invite people (by username, or on GitLab by email), make them editors or owners, and remove them. Backends gain an optional `editors` capability. On GitHub, changing editors and GitHub Pages settings needs an owner token, which the new `ownerAccess` keeps in memory for the tab only; it replaces the Pages token link (`PagesDomains.tokenLink` is removed). On GitLab, owners can let editors publish to the main branch.
- 8176568: `githubSetup()` and `gitlabSetup()` create a site's repository from the browser, for the documentation site's setup page: they list the accounts and groups the person can create it in, create it on the branch `main` with every file in one first commit, and turn on GitHub Pages (or make a private project's GitLab Pages public). On GitHub they also add a rule that stops the main branch's history being rewritten or deleted, where the plan allows it. GitLab sign-in can be by redirect, with PKCE. The fakes in `@goodfellow-cms/github/testing` and `@goodfellow-cms/gitlab/testing` can create repositories too.
- d09a681: Automatic updates: `goodfellow update` (and `goodfellow-next update`) updates a site to Goodfellow's newest fixes, or a release it's given, with the Puck version that release uses, and updates blocks from Goodfellow's registry, replacing only files nobody changed (`planUpdate()`). It publishes the update only once the site installs and builds with it, and otherwise puts everything back. The starters' GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages setups run it each night. **Site settings → Updates** shows the site's release, fixes and newer releases, and the last update, installs fixes now, lets owners install a newer release, and on GitLab turns on job token pushes and a nightly schedule. Owners can turn automatic fixes off and go back to the previous release, which updates then skip until it's allowed again; these settings live in a new content file, `content/updates.json`. Backends gain an optional `updates` capability; the GitHub owner token can now run workflows.
- 7785ef5: Version history: pages, the header and footer, and collections' items have a **Version history** screen in the admin panel, listing every published version with who published it and when, a preview of each, and **Restore this version**, which publishes it again. Backends gain `history()` and `readAt()`, implemented for GitHub and GitLab and their fakes.

### Patch Changes

- 699e0dd: Goodfellow's repository moved to the `goodfellow-cms` organization on GitHub. Package READMEs and repository links, and the admin panel's link to release notes, now point to https://github.com/goodfellow-cms/goodfellow-cms and the documentation at https://goodfellow-cms.github.io/goodfellow-cms/.
  
  The starters' READMEs link to the documentation instead of sections of Goodfellow's README, which is now shorter.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1bfecf7: Publishing to GitHub and GitLab. New `@goodfellow-cms/github` and `@goodfellow-cms/gitlab` backends edit a site's repository straight from the browser: GitHub with an access token from a prefilled link, GitLab with one-click OAuth (PKCE) or a token. Set `backend` in `goodfellow.config.tsx` and `goodfellow build` includes the admin panel at `/admin/`, with a sign-in screen, an account menu and a live-site status that follows the deploy after each publish. `@goodfellow-cms/core` adds the `GitHost` and `GitBackend` interfaces, `writeChanges()` (which saves over other people's changes to other files but never the same ones), and `@goodfellow-cms/core/testing` with an in-memory repository for fakes. `goodfellow dev` gives each site its own Vite cache and keeps watching content when folders are replaced.
- ece9ba5: The media library. A new **Media** screen uploads, replaces and deletes images and files in `public/media/`, saying where a file is used before deleting it. Image fields in blocks, page settings, collection items and site settings get a **Choose image** button that picks from the library or uploads a new file. Large photos are shrunk, JPEGs lose hidden details such as location, SVGs lose scripts, and only file types that can't run code are accepted. Previews show new uploads straight away, and add the site's base path to media addresses. `FileChange` can now carry `bytes`, and every store implements `readBytes()`, with both backends, their fakes and the development server supporting uploads. `@goodfellow-cms/react` adds `mediaField()`, used by the Image and Section blocks, and the AI assistant is told which images the site has.

### Patch Changes

- 4ca2dc1: Every package has a README, keywords and links to its documentation, repository and issues, for its page on npm. All the packages are released together with the same version.
- d91eea1: The packages are published under the `@goodfellow-cms` scope on npm, such as `@goodfellow-cms/core` and `@goodfellow-cms/react`, since `@goodfellow` was taken. `goodfellow` and `create-goodfellow` keep their names, and the block registry's name in `components.json` and refs such as `@goodfellow/shadcn-faq` stays `@goodfellow`.
