An address of its own for the admin panel, such as `admin.example.org`, so the site's pages can't reach what it keeps. Site Settings' Domain screen sets it on GitLab Pages, Cloudflare Pages and Vercel, writing the config's new `admin` line: `goodfellow build` and `goodfellow-next finish` then start every page with a script that sends it to the Site address when it's opened at the admin address, fail if a page can't start with it, and write Cloudflare Pages' header rules, while the starters' `vercel.ts` and `withGoodfellow()` give Vercel's. Once the admin panel has checked the address from there, it opens only there and refuses to be shown in a frame. The sign-in worker gives tokens to the admin address too. The Blocks screen offers blocks from the config's `registries`, and shadcn/ui's own, only at a checked admin address and in `goodfellow dev` and `next dev`. GitLab's backend can publish files outside the editable folders, such as the config.
