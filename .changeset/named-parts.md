Every part of a block has a stable name, such as `gf-heading` or `gf-card-title`, and **Colors & fonts → Blocks' parts** gives a part classes for every block of that kind at once, kept in `content/site.json`'s `theme.parts`. A part's classes come after the block's own and before what's chosen for each block, so a choice made for one block still wins. Blocks name their parts with `useParts()` and declare them with `withParts()`, from `@goodfellow-cms/react`; the registry's blocks name theirs after themselves, such as `gf-shadcn-cards-title`. Images and videos with **Rounded corners** off now have the `rounded-none` class, and Rows that don't wrap `flex-nowrap`, so a theme's classes can't change them.
