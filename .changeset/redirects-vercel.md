Redirects: the page at an old address now says where it's sending visitors, with a link named after the page, in words the Redirects tab can change, and replaces itself in the browser's history, so Back no longer needs pressing twice. On Vercel, Vercel sends the redirects itself: new sites have a `vercel.ts` in place of `vercel.json` that reads them, and Next.js sites get them from `withGoodfellow()`. Redirects from addresses that pages have are left out, so pages still win.
