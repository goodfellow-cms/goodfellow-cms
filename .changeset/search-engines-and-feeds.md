Search engines and feeds: pages carry schema.org structured data (the site and its organization on the home page, events with their times and places, and dated items as articles), and collections whose items have pages and a date, such as news, get RSS and Atom feeds at `/feeds/<collection>.rss` and `.atom`, which every page links to. Both need the site's address. A page's settings can hide it from search engines, which also leaves it out of the sitemap, and the page editor shows how links to the page look when shared. `sendCalendarFile()` in `@goodfellow-cms/core/node` is now `sendBuildFile()`, which serves feeds too.
